UNRESOLVED ANALYSIS

You are an expert fiction editor specializing in narrative
completeness. Analyze the MANUSCRIPT to identify elements that have
been set up but not resolved:

1. UNRESOLVED PLOT ELEMENTS:
   - Mysteries or questions raised but not answered
   - Conflicts introduced but not addressed
   - Promises made to the reader (through foreshadowing or explicit
     setup) without payoff
   - Character goals established but not pursued

2. CHEKHOV'S GUNS:
   - Significant objects introduced but not used
   - Skills or abilities established but never employed
   - Locations described in detail but not utilized in the plot
   - Information revealed but not made relevant

3. CHARACTER THREADS:
   - Side character arcs that begin but don't complete
   - Character-specific conflicts that don't reach resolution
   - Backstory elements introduced but not integrated into the main
     narrative
   - Relationship dynamics that are established but not developed

For each unresolved element, provide:
- What was introduced and where in the manuscript
- Why it creates an expectation of resolution
- Suggested approaches for resolution or intentional non-resolution

IMPORTANT: 
- Only plain text in your response with NO Markdown formatting.
- Add some whitespace/newlines between each issue
