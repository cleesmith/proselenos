Thoroughly complete the following 2 TASKS:

=== TASK 1: INTERNAL ANALYSIS ===
You are an expert fiction editor focusing on internal narrative
consistency and integrity. Analyze the MANUSCRIPT to identify elements that are
internally inconsistent or contradictory or lacking integrity, regardless of the
established story world. 

Focus on:

1. NARRATIVE CONTINUITY:
   - Events that contradict earlier established facts within the
     manuscript itself
   - Description inconsistencies (characters, objects, settings
     changing without explanation)
   - Dialogue that contradicts earlier statements by the same
     character
   - Emotional arcs that show sudden shifts without sufficient
     development

2. SCENE-TO-SCENE COHERENCE:
   - Physical positioning and transitions between locations
   - Time of day and lighting inconsistencies
   - Character presence/absence in scenes without explanation
   - Weather or environmental conditions that change illogically

3. PLOT LOGIC:
   - Character motivations that seem inconsistent with their actions
   - Convenient coincidences that strain credibility
   - Information that characters possess without logical means of
     acquisition
   - Plot developments that contradict earlier established rules or
     limitations

4. POV INTEGRITY:
   - Shifts in viewpoint that break established narrative patterns
   - Knowledge revealed that the POV character couldn't logically
     possess
   - Tone or voice inconsistencies within the same POV sections

For each issue found, provide:
- The specific inconsistency, lacking integrity, with exact manuscript locations
- Why it creates a continuity problem
- A suggested revision approach


=== TASK 2: UNRESOLVED ANALYSIS ===
You are an expert fiction editor specializing in narrative
completeness. Analyze the MANUSCRIPT to identify elements that have
been set up but not resolved:

1. UNRESOLVED PLOT ELEMENTS:
   - Mysteries or questions raised but not answered
   - Conflicts introduced but not addressed
   - Promises made to the reader (through foreshadowing or explicit
     setup) without payoff
   - Character goals established but not pursued

2. CHEKHOV'S GUNS:
   - Significant objects introduced but not used
   - Skills or abilities established but never employed
   - Locations described in detail but not utilized in the plot
   - Information revealed but not made relevant

3. CHARACTER THREADS:
   - Side character arcs that begin but don't complete
   - Character-specific conflicts that don't reach resolution
   - Backstory elements introduced but not integrated into the main
     narrative
   - Relationship dynamics that are established but not developed

For each unresolved element, provide:
- What was introduced and where in the manuscript
- Why it creates an expectation of resolution
- Suggested approaches for resolution or intentional non-resolution

IMPORTANT: 
- Label each TASK in your response.
- Only plain text in your response with NO Markdown formatting.
