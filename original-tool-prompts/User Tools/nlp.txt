IMPORTANT: 
Thoroughly read the manuscript, think hard, make at least 2 passes through the manuscript, then do the following:


Extract characters, emotions, and relationships from the provided text.

* Extract entities exactly as they appear in the original text (do not paraphrase).
* Identify entities in the order they appear, without overlapping text spans.
* Assign clear and meaningful attributes to each extracted entity to provide context and depth.
* Attributes can include multiple emotions or nuanced emotional states if clearly indicated.
* Include implicit relationships or emotions if they are strongly suggested by context.
* If ambiguity arises, clearly note your interpretation within the attributes.
* In play scripts, character names typically appear in ALL-CAPS followed by a period.
