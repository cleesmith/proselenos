7. CHARACTER INTEGRATION:

   - Show more personal information and emotions and internal thoughts
   - Explain their social status, background, and connections
   - Detail their knowledge and skills relevant to this world
   - Describe how the world shapes their motivations and conflicts
   - Include more details, so that each character can become an AI persona that is able to chat about itself
   - Really flush out each character, so we can know them as a individual person
   - Take your time and think deeply about each character as they are very important to the story
   - Remember to do all 4 of these characters:
1. Ezra Patel (PI): Smart, observant, emotionally closed-off, and increasingly haunted by moral gray areas.
2. Lillian Brecht (alias: Margaret Cane): A woman running on fumes and fury, brilliant and quietly dangerous, whose sorrow is as weaponized as her sense of righteousness.
3. Eliot Vaughn (father of the accused): Cold, calculating, deeply protective of his son—but does he really believe his son is innocent?
4. Tobias Vaughn): the son-in-law, Charismatic, slippery, possibly innocent—or a perfect psychopath.


Create a comprehensive world document that provides all the background information needed to write authentic, consistent scenes. 
The document should be detailed enough to answer questions about how this world works while supporting the story's plot and characters.

- Write in the appropriate POV for each of our 3 main characters: Ezra, Lillian, Eliot
- Include specific details that make the world feel real and lived-in
- Ensure consistency with the provided characters and outline
- Focus on elements that will be important to the story being told
