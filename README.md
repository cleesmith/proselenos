# Proselenos

Proselenos is a web application that helps writers, authors, and editors analyze and improve your manuscripts using AI-powered tools. 
Your manuscripts stay on your Google Drive, and you control when and how A.I. (AI) assistance is applied to your work.

## Why Proselenos Exists

This web app is not a startup looking for users or a company planning to 
monetize later. I'm retired, I love books, and I wanted to help writers 
access AI editing without the usual tech industry nonsense. 
That's it. 
That's the business model, as in not one at all.

If you find Proselenos helpful, just tell another writer about it.
